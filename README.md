Please installing using [App Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.app_manager) or [Split APKs Installer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtv.sai)

Please check the Releases tab on the right hand side for the built XAPK files.

You'll have to uninstall the game and re-install with our translated version as the signatures won't match.

**Please make sure you have backed up a screenshot of your account transfer code before trying to install the translated version.**

Note that while playing the translated version you can't make any in-app purchases, I suggeest to perform your purchases with the PC version as the lapis and whatever else you purchase will sync to Android.
